# Webscraping_libraries
This is a project that scrapes library operational hours and determine whether they are open at the moment.
* web scraping
* datetime function

### Notes added in 2020:
This program does not run as it intended at the moment, probably due to the fact that COVID-forced lockdown of libraries, 
operational hours were no longer displayed in the same format as they used to.
